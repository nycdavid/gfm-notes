## GFM Notes
At RailsConf 2014, as I was furiously trying to scribble/type notes of all of the amazing 
presenters and speakers, I found myself wishing that I could use Vim and have beautiful 
formatting at the same time.

Then I thought to myself, "Can't I just use Markdown?" Thus this project was
born. The folks that will get the most use out of this little Sinatra app are
those people that are most comfortable in Vim and want to stay in it rather than
having to switch to a different program to write notes.

There are many more features to come, but for now it's a Markdown rendering
server.
